For my assignment I decided to recreate a scene from Ender's Game (2013). Not the oldest Sci-Fi film, but it's got amazing looking space ships and drones that even show a flocking behaviour in the film itself. It's about space battle strategy, so it's a good fit for an AI demo (Star Wars has great ships from their Clone Wars era too, but it's been overdone..)

Some shots from the film:

# assets

The problem is that I can't find any ship models for the film at all. Sadly I'll have to either download more generic replacements, or make simple/lower-poly versions myself. I hope that doesn't lose me any points :)

# AI behaviours

For the scene I'll be using drones with a flocking behaviour, making different formations, avoiding collision, overall some target chasing maneuvers. The frigates will be using simpler, slower moves and will be in formation.

# storyboard

The scene is a battle between Earth's fleet and some alien spaceships. The conflict begins as the humans "run into" a group of alien ships collecting water from some icy rocks in an asteroid belt. We strike first, deploying drone boids, and after some good boid-on-boid action, the camera reveals some of the human frigates have split from the group, positioning themselves behind/below the icy asteroids that were being mined. Just as they are spotted, the shots are off and the outflanked alien spaceships are in pieces. In a final stand, the alien boids swarm the flagship and the human boids make a formation around it, shielding it. The flagship ends the scene with a flashy superweapon, chaining bolts of lightning through the remaining alien boids.

Well, I hope the story isn't a little too ambitious
